# Adopt a Pet

## Codecademy project

### Flask

On the pet adoption website, you can browse through the categories of animals and select the one you’re interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.

In this project, I’ll use Python’s Flask framework to create a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.
